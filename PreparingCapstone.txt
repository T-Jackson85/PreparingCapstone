Family Activity Planner

I will be creating a family planning app that will allow members to share events amongst fellow, invited members in the group. My app will be completed using React and Node. I plan on making this an evenly focused app, considering the user experience relies on the mainly on what is stored on the backend database. I would like for users to be able to access the app via website and mobile.  My goal is to allow members to view upcoming events for their designated group. This helps with privacy and inclusivity. Members will also be able to view vital information such as contact info on fellow group members. All users will remain private with only their names displaying when searched, unless they are members of the same group. The app will also allow members to host events, assign tasks to events, and even expenses pertaining to the cost of the event. Even though the app is designed for families, I would like to attract friend groups, teams, and even work-related groups that have to plan together. Data for the app will come from stored information added by users. So, I will construct my own schema so that data is properly stored and reusable. I will require authentication to help secure personal data including name, birthdate, email, and passwords.
